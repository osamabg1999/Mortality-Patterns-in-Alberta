##  Introduction
Death is an indisputable fact of life, an unavoidable reality that is frequently veiled in silence. It is one of society's deepest taboos, owing to the enormous sentiments of terror and despair that it evokes. However, concealed behind this conundrum is a wealth of knowledge waiting to be explored. Extensive data has been methodically collected and analyzed over the years to unravel the complexities of its nature, causes, and chronology. Although we cannot avoid its inevitable embrace, we can embrace a deeper understanding and identify areas where improvements can be made. For our project, we will perform a gender and age group analysis of mortality patterns in Alberta. We have data spanning over a period of twenty years which will aid us in studying various death causes across all age groups and genders. There are many insights that can be extracted from this data, such as leading causes of death in a particular age group or ratio of deaths by accident in any given year. There are many layers to unfold, and we are determined to bring forth some essential insights.

## Project Goal and Motivation
The project aims to identify the leading causes of death using data spanning from 2001 to 2022, establishing a fundamental understanding of the mortality landscape. Once the top causes are identified, the analysis will delve into potential gender disparities. Are specific causes of death more prevalent among males, while others are more common among females? Recognizing these gender differences can provide guidance for healthcare and prevention strategies.

The extended examination over this substantial time frame can reveal trends in the leading causes of death. Look for consistent patterns, significant changes, or fluctuations across the years. Additionally, breaking down the mortality data into various age groups can help pinpoint causes of death that vary among different age cohorts. Are there certain causes that disproportionately affect specific age groups, such as young adults, middle-aged individuals, or seniors? Are there indications of certain causes becoming more prevalent over time, suggesting emerging health concerns? On the other hand, are there causes that are on the decline? Understanding these trends can offer valuable insights for targeted interventions.

By comprehensively addressing these questions, you can provide valuable insights into how these trends impact public health, healthcare systems, and the overall well-being of the population in Alberta. The implications of these findings for public health planning, healthcare resource allocation, and policy development are immense.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

## Conclusion
In 2001, Alberta's population stood at 2,974,807, and it has since grown to 4,510,891 in 2022 (Population statistics | Alberta.ca, n.d.). With this substantial population increase, it's only natural to anticipate a corresponding rise in the death rate. Indeed, the data supports this assumption, revealing a modest increase in mortality over the timeline.

The top mortality trends call for several critical actions:

Increase Cancer Funding: To address the growing burden of cancer-related deaths, it is imperative to allocate additional resources for researching new treatment methods and enhancing early screening tests. This investment can lead to improved patient outcomes and early detection.

Prevent Heart Disease: Implementing a comprehensive action plan to prevent heart disease is essential. This plan should encompass aspects such as monitoring sodium intake, promoting regular exercise, and increasing public awareness about heart health.

Addressing Dementia: There is a concerning upward trajectory in dementia cases. Alberta's health authorities and policymakers must prioritize investigations into this issue, working to understand the causes and develop strategies for prevention and care.

Mental Health Focus: Mental health is a pressing concern across all age groups, with a particularly alarming prevalence of suicide among younger individuals. Allocating resources and implementing programs that address mental health is paramount to reduce these devastating statistics.

Combat Poisoning Incidents: Poisoning, whether due to overdose or intentional actions, is impacting the population at large. A comprehensive approach involving law enforcement, healthcare services, and social initiatives is necessary to address this issue effectively and prevent further harm.

In light of the changing demographic landscape and the evolving causes of death, these actions are crucial to promote the health and well-being of Alberta's residents and ensure a brighter, healthier future for the province.
